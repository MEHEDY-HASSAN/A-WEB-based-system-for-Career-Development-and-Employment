# A-WEB-based-system-for-Career-Development-and-Employment

“A WEB-based system for Career Development and Employment” is a business and employment-focused social media platform. Here one can post any of their thoughts, queries, or achievements based on any particular topic. Also, one can post a work on the job site if he/she is an expert in that field. Throughout this system, one can get paid for the service he/she provides and one can get his/her job done by professional developers.

The user interface was built using ***Angular***. The application logic layer or the back-end is handled 
using the ***Django*** REST framework. To handle different operations on the database SQLite 
database management system was used.
